# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Streamlit. It utilizes content-based filtering to recommend movies to users based on the attributes of movies they like.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.

## Dataset

The project uses the following datasets:

- **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: Contains information about movies, including titles, genres, and other attributes.
- **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: Contains information about the cast and crew associated with the movies.

## Features

- **Content-Based Filtering**: The recommendation system suggests movies based on similarities in their attributes.
- **User Interface**: Built using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.
